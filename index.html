					Overview
				</span>
				<p>This project was inspired by a friend who came to me with a problem. Recently laid off from a large
					Seattle-area tech company, he was looking for a new job.
					While there were many services to help find jobs, finding a good match with unique skills and
					experiences required many hours manually parsing job descriptions for a good fit.
					<br>
					<br>
					What if there was a service that could process and match your resume with related jobs and deliver a ranked list of results daily to aid your job search?
					<br>
					<br>
					With that idea in mind, we worked together to create Job Matcher, a service that scraped job posting
					websites and used natural language processing to compute similarities between the postings and user
					resumes. It would prioritize skills (for example, Ruby or AWS Sagemaker) and return to the user a
					set of matched jobs ranked by the machine learning model's scoring criteria daily. The job
					position scraping and matching would be automated via a daily asyncronous API call to an EC2 instance so by the time
					the user logged in, the results would already be persisted and presented to them on the client side.
				</p>
				<span class="strong">
					Architecture
				</span>	

				<p>The application consists of several main components: The flask server handles the client interaction including user identification and metadata persistence (resume, email, etc.). To communicate with the MongoDB cluster, we exposed pathways via FastAPI to allow for new user creation, updating of user details, and getting the latest matched resumes. Depending on which API pathway is called, we utilize the SpaCy NLP library to look for skills in the jobs and calculate semantic similarity with the user's information.</p>
