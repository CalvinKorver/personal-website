				Overview
			</span>
			<p>This project was inspired by a friend who came to me with a problem. Recently laid off from a large Seattle-area tech company, he was looking for a new job. 
				While there were many services to help find jobs, finding a good match with  unique skills and experiences was manual and required many hours of parsing job descriptions and looking for a good fit.
				<br>
				<br>
				What if there was a service that would process and match your resume with related jobs and return the list of matches to your inbox every morning?
				<br>
				<br>
				With that goal in mind, we worked together to create Job Matcher, a service that scraped job posting websites and used natural language processing to compute similarities between the postings and user resumes. It would prioritize skills (for example, Ruby or AWS Sagemaker) and return to the user a set of matched jobs ranked by the machine learning model's scoring criteria every day. The job position scraping and matching would be automated via a daily asyncronous API call so by the time the user logged in, the results would already be persisted and presented to them on the client side.
